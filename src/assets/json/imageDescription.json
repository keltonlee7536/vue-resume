Iâ€™ve done electrical fixes, brakes, all sorts of stuff. it can be pretty messy, but nothing teaches patience quite like a 30 year old car that has no purpose in life except to break down. there's also something to be said about how working on a car can be therepudic, but if I'm being honest, I wouldn't mind if it went a month or two without breaking down."
