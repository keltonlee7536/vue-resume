I wouldnt call myself a professional, but Iâ€™ve done a power steering pump, brakes, an oil pan(which was quite an ordeal), the fuel pump, all sorts of stuff. it can be pretty messy, but nothing teaches patience quite like a 30 year old car that loves to break down. there's also something to be said about how working on a car can be therepudic, but if I'm being honest, I wouldn't mind if it went a month or two without breaking down."

        "description": "My music taste is sporatic at best and difficult to pin down. recently, I've been listening to music from Movies and Video Games. These incude the Bourne Trilogy, Limitless (2011), and American Beauty(which also happen to be some of my favroite movies). From video games I love the soundtracks from Halo, Modern Warfare 2, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, and others."
